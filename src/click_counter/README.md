<h1>In this section we...</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Set up a simple React App with Jest & Enzyme</li>
  <li>Used Enzyme's shallow() function to render a component as a <strong>unit</strong> to ensure tests aren't indirectly asserting on behavior of child components.  </li>
  <li>Tested that required DOM elements were rendered using <em>find()</em></li>
  <li>Used Enzyme's <em>.text()</em> method to extract the text of an element</li>
  <li>Used <em>simulate</em> to interact with rendered elements (such as a clicked btn)</li>
  <li>Tested components for update after interaction</li>
  <li>created re-usable <em>setup()</em> and <em>findByTestAttr()</em> functions</li>
</ul>
